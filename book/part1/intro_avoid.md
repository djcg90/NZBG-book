# Why do we build bridges?

Introduction to the "Avoid" part. (split over multiple parts).

Start with the trickiest and most abstract concept for many bridge designers. Often brushed aside.

Acknowledge large chains of command, lack of decision making power etc. Acknowledge that progress needs to be linear, and decisions made need to stick. Acknowledge that not building is not an option. Society needs infrastructure.

BUT.

Even given all this. Observe the context.
State of the climate. Extreme times. Open eyes.

Then frame construction industries contribution to this.
.. and bridges/transportation infrastructure within this.

We are not going to save the planet on our own. But every community is going to have to prepare for and initiate dramatic changes. This is our bit.

There are many of us who **are** involved in decision making. Whether we are advising clients directly, sitting on review panels, crunching numbers for optioneering exercises, responding to tenders, or commenting in the industry press. It matters that the community has the ability to question the value of what we enable. We are the experts and we are heard, but we have to be consistent to be effective.

SO...

To be able to contribute we must understand how infrastructure decision-making is carried out, and we need to be able to "kick the tyres". Not least because in a world where carbon emissions are increasingly regulated and agressively challenged, a weakness in this aspect is a major project risk.

DfT guidance. Local Authorities. Main public clients - investment strategies. Private clients. Scale.

Understand optioneering process. When are the arguments made and how are they judged.

Demonstrate some heuristics.
User vs embodied carbon. Discounting over typical life-time. Carbon pay-back.
Influence of road geometry.
Influence of congestion.
Cost of detours.
Interaction between carbon price and investment.
Carbon cost of infrastructure per unit.
Modal shifts. Rail vs Plane vs Car.
Land-use change.

If it still makes sense... can we avoid some of it?

Assess marginal impact. Prioritise sub-options.
De-scope. Re-scope.
Push it back.
MVP.
Adaptability/safe-guarding resources for future.

Talking about this. Appropriate channels. Communication strategies. Timing. Examples of good professional practice.
