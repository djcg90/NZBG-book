Welcome to this reference text for net-zero bridge design.

This is a community-developed open-source project hosted by the {term}`Net-Zero Bridges Group` (NZBG) in the United Kingdom.

:::{note}
The Net-Zero Bridges Group are a community of practictioners representing many of the leading bridge design firms in the UK - check out the [NZBG website](https://www.netzerobridges.org/) for more information.

The immediate objective of this project is to collate detailed and up-to-date guidance on low-carbon design for UK-based bridge designers. We hope that from the outset this resource will help users design structures that are *best-in-class* from a whole-life carbon perspective. 

Importantly, there are two features of this resource that the reader should be aware of.

1. This book is published in an open forum on Github (PROVIDE LINK). Contributions, comments and debate are essential and welcomed *inline* directly in the source repository. Additions to the book are controlled and curated by a rolling panel drawn from the NZBG. Guidance, advice and encouragement for would-be contributors can be found [here](part5/community_contribution.md).
   > There is a lot to do in a short-space of time. Any help you can lend will be appreciated.

2. This is an example of an [Executable Book](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/), an online resource that mixes long-form narrative content, with code and calculations. Think of it like a traditional text book, except that the worked examples are live.

The medium-term goal is that community development of this resource will allow it to evolve swiftly to reflect and embody an accelerating green transition.

Ultimately, with widespread engagement and institutional endorsement, we hope to become a genuine forum for debate and innovation;  with real influence and a structure that encourages faster progress in the development of general practice.

It is worth noting that this book willingly steps outside the siloed realm of the bridge designer into other infrastructure disciplines and makes no excuses for doing so. Through challenge and cross-pollination of ideas we seek to better ourselves and the planet.

This resource is published as a **web friendly** text book. A static pdf can also be downloaded from here...(TODO)

UK practitioners are likely to be familiar with the publicly available specification {term}`PAS2080:2023` [Carbon Management in Infrastructure and Built Environment](https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/insights-and-media/insights/brochures/pas-2080-carbon-management-in-infrastructure-and-built-environment/). For convenience this book seeks to align terminology with PAS2080, and in structure it follows the same high-level carbon reduction hierarchy.

Finally it concludes with some detailed observations on infrastructure project delivery in the UK context; some specific trends, pressure points and blockers that the NZBG have identified as requiring a step-change in behaviour.
